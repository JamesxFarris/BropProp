# Design notes

A living document. Decisions and constraints get written down here as they're
made, so the dashboard stays coherent instead of drifting.

## Standing constraints

Non-negotiable, from the outset:

- **No purple gradients.** No violet-to-indigo anything — backgrounds, buttons,
  headers, charts.
- **No "AI" iconography.** No sparkles, magic wands, stars, brains, robots.
- **Nothing that reads as vibe-coded.** No glassmorphism, no frosted cards
  floating on a gradient mesh, no neon glow, no oversized hero with a tagline.
- **Clean.** Restraint over decoration.

Those rule things *out*. What follows is what we're doing *instead* — the part
that actually makes it look like something.

## What this thing actually is

A tool for reading numbers fast and deciding on slips. The user is scanning for
disagreement between two books and for lines that moved. Everything follows
from that:

**Density is a feature, not a flaw.** The failure mode of a "clean" dashboard is
four giant stat cards with 40px numbers, on a page that answers no question.
Twenty rows of legible, well-aligned data beats four decorative tiles. Think
trading terminal or a printed stats almanac, not a SaaS marketing page.

**Colour encodes meaning or it isn't used.** There is no brand accent sprinkled
around for warmth. Colour means: line moved up, line moved down, books disagree,
market is stale. A page where colour is decoration is a page where colour can't
carry information — and the whole product is a colour-codeable signal.

**Numbers are the typography.** Tabular figures throughout, so digits form
columns and the eye can compare down a row without reading. Right-align every
numeral. Line values (`28.5`) and diffs (`-2.5`) are the largest type on the
page; labels are small and quiet. This single decision does more for the way it
looks than any palette will.

**Every screen answers a question.** Not "here's your data" but *where do the
books disagree right now*, *what moved since I last looked*, *which of my logged
edges actually hit*. If a component doesn't answer one, it's cut.

**Show the data's honesty.** Sample size next to every hit rate. A timestamp on
every number, because a line from 40 minutes ago is a different fact from a line
from 40 seconds ago. Staleness gets shown, not hidden. This is a tool that will
be wrong sometimes; the design shouldn't project false confidence.

## Practical rules

- Neutral ground (near-white or near-black), one signal colour per direction,
  nothing else. Both themes carry the full palette.
- Borders and spacing for structure — not shadows.
- One type family, or a text face plus a mono for figures. No display fonts.
- Icons only where a word won't do, and from one set. Never as ornament.
- Tables scroll inside their own container; the page never scrolls sideways.
- Empty states say what's missing and when it'll fill, since much of this data
  only accrues over time.

## Open decisions

- Visual direction: terminal-dense vs. editorial-print. *(pending)*
- Stack for the dashboard — likely Next.js reading the same Postgres.
- Whether grading results live in the same view as live lines, or separately.

## Log

- **2026-09-06** — Constraints above set at project start. Scope narrowed to
  CS2 and LoL only; Apex and Valorant dropped from the default poll.
